This repository hosts a planetary geostrophic circulation model (𝜈PGCM) that solves the 3D planetary geostrophic (PG) equations using finite elements.
The model is written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and can run on a GPU.
Check out the [documentation](https://hgpeterson.github.io/nuPGCM/) if you want to learn more!
