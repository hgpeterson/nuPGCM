This folder contains some postprocessing scripts that I have used to analyze output files from the νPGCM.
The scripts are in Python, and they make use of the [`pyvista`](https://pyvista.org/) package for analyzing `.vtu` files.
To install the relevant dependencies, do
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
